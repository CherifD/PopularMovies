An android app that displays movies posters from themoviedb.org api, provides sorting options and allows viewing movie details.

Note: To get this app to work, you will need to get your own api key from www.themoviedb.org. Then you will need to assign 
your key to the API_KEY variable, in the gradle.properties file.

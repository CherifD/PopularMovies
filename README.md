An android app that displays movies from themoviedb.org, provides sorting options and allows viewing movie details.

Note: To get this app to work, you will need to get your own api key from www.themoviedb.org. Then you will need to assign 
your key to the MY_API_KEY variable, in the NetworkUtils class.
